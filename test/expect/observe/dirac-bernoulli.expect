Support is a subset of: [1/2, 1/2]

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 0.25
Expected value:            E = 0.5
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 0.25
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 0.125
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 0.0625
Standard deviation:        σ = 1.0202127648613718e-8
Variance (2nd central):    V = 2.0816681711721688e-16
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 1.3877787807814457e-17
4th central moment:      μ_4 = -6.938893903907233e-17
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = NaN
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = inf
