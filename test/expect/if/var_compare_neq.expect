Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 7}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 7/8
Expected value:            E = 53/14
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = (not a rational)
Variance:                  V = 1013/196
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = (not a rational)
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 1866377/1026169

Computing probabilities up to 8...
Unnormalized: p(0)     = 3/32
Normalized:   p(0) / Z = 3/28
Unnormalized: p(1)     = 3/32
Normalized:   p(1) / Z = 3/28
Unnormalized: p(2)     = 3/32
Normalized:   p(2) / Z = 3/28
Unnormalized: p(3)     = 3/32
Normalized:   p(3) / Z = 3/28
Unnormalized: p(4)     = 1/8
Normalized:   p(4) / Z = 1/7
Unnormalized: p(5)     = 1/8
Normalized:   p(5) / Z = 1/7
Unnormalized: p(6)     = 1/8
Normalized:   p(6) / Z = 1/7
Unnormalized: p(7)     = 1/8
Normalized:   p(7) / Z = 1/7
Unnormalized: p(n)     <= 0 for all n >= 8
