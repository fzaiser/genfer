Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 7}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1/8
Expected value:            E = 3/2
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = NaN
Variance:                  V = 5/4
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 0
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 41/25

Computing probabilities up to 8...
Unnormalized: p(0)     = 1/32
Normalized:   p(0) / Z = 1/4
Unnormalized: p(1)     = 1/32
Normalized:   p(1) / Z = 1/4
Unnormalized: p(2)     = 1/32
Normalized:   p(2) / Z = 1/4
Unnormalized: p(3)     = 1/32
Normalized:   p(3) / Z = 1/4
Unnormalized: p(4)     = 0
Normalized:   p(4) / Z = 0
Unnormalized: p(5)     = 0
Normalized:   p(5) / Z = 0
Unnormalized: p(6)     = 0
Normalized:   p(6) / Z = 0
Unnormalized: p(7)     = 0
Normalized:   p(7) / Z = 0
Unnormalized: p(n)     <= 0 for all n >= 8
Normalized:   p(n) / Z <= 0 for all n >= 8
