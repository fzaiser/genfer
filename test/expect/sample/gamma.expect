Support is a subset of: [0, ∞)

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 2.5
Standard deviation:        σ = 5.0
Variance:                  V = 25.000000000000004
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 3.999999999999999
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 26.999999999999986
