Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 2.5
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 31.25
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 703.125
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 22851.5625
Standard deviation:        σ = 5.0
Variance (2nd central):    V = 25.000000000000004
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 500.0
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 16875.0
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 3.999999999999999
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 26.999999999999993
