Support is a subset of: {0, ...}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 1
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = NaN
Variance:                  V = 2
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = NaN
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 19/2

Computing probabilities up to 12...
p(0) = 1/2
p(1) = 1/4
p(2) = 1/8
p(3) = 1/16
p(4) = 1/32
p(5) = 1/64
p(6) = 1/128
p(7) = 1/256
p(8) = 1/512
p(9) = 1/1024
p(10) = 1/2048
p(11) = 1/4096
p(n) <= 1/4096 for all n >= 12
