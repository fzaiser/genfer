Support is a subset of: [0, ∞)

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 10.0
Standard deviation:        σ = 10.0
Variance:                  V = 100.00000000000001
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 1.9999999999999991
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 8.999999999999996
