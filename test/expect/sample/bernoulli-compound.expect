Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 0.25
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 0.25
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 0.25
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 0.25
Standard deviation:        σ = 0.43301270189221935
Variance (2nd central):    V = 0.1875
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 0.09375000000000001
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 0.08203124999999997
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 1.1547005383792515
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 2.333333333333332

Computing probabilities up to 2...
