Support is a subset of: {2}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 2.0
Standard deviation:        σ = 4.080851059445487e-8
Variance:                  V = 3.33066907387547e-15
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = NaN
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = inf

Computing probabilities up to 3...
p(0) = 0.0
p(1) = 0.0
p(2) = 1.0
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 3
