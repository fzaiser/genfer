Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 4}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 2.0
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 6.0
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 20.0
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 72.0
Standard deviation:        σ = 1.4142135623730947
Variance (2nd central):    V = 1.9999999999999987
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = -3.552713678800504e-15
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 7.99999999999995
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = -1.2560739669470302e-15

Computing probabilities up to 5...
p(0) = 0.25
p(1) = 0.0
p(2) = 0.5
p(3) = 0.0
p(4) = 0.25
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 5
