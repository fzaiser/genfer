Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 4}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 2.0
Standard deviation:        σ = 1.4142135623730947
Variance:                  V = 1.9999999999999987
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = -1.2560739669470302e-15
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 1.9999999999999898

Computing probabilities up to 5...
p(0) = 0.25
p(1) = 0.0
p(2) = 0.5
p(3) = 0.0
p(4) = 0.25
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 5
