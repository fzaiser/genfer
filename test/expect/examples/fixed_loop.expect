Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 5}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 5/2
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = NaN
Variance:                  V = 5/4
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 0
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 13/5

Computing probabilities up to 6...
p(0) = 1/32
p(1) = 5/32
p(2) = 5/16
p(3) = 5/16
p(4) = 5/32
p(5) = 1/32
p(n) <= 0 for all n >= 6
