Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 5}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 5/2
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 15/2
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 25
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 90
Standard deviation:        σ = (not a rational)
Variance (2nd central):    V = 5/4
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 0
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 65/16
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 0
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 13/5

Computing probabilities up to 6...
p(0) = 1/32
p(1) = 5/32
p(2) = 5/16
p(3) = 5/16
p(4) = 5/32
p(5) = 1/32
p(n) <= 0 for all n >= 6
