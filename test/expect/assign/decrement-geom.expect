Support is a subset of: {0, ...}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 1/8
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = (not a rational)
Variance:                  V = 23/64
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = (not a rational)
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 1531/23

Computing probabilities up to 8...
p(0) = 15/16
p(1) = 1/32
p(2) = 1/64
p(3) = 1/128
p(4) = 1/256
p(5) = 1/512
p(6) = 1/1024
p(7) = 1/2048
p(n) <= 1/2048 for all n >= 8
