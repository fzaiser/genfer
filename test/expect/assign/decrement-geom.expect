Support is a subset of: {0, ...}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 1/8
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 3/8
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 13/8
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 75/8
Standard deviation:        σ = (not a rational)
Variance (2nd central):    V = 23/64
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 381/256
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 35213/4096
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = (not a rational)
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 1531/23
