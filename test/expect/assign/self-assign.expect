Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 3.0
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 9.0
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 27.0
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 81.0
Standard deviation:        σ = 6.664001874625058e-8
Variance (2nd central):    V = 8.881784197001254e-15
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 1.7763568394002505e-15
4th central moment:      μ_4 = -2.842170943040401e-14
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = NaN
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = inf

Computing probabilities up to 4...
p(0) = 0.0
p(1) = 0.0
p(2) = 0.0
p(3) = 1.0
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 4
