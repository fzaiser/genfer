Support is a subset of: {8}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 8
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 0
Variance:                  V = 0
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = (not a rational)
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = (not a rational)

Computing probabilities up to 9...
p(0) = 0
p(1) = 0
p(2) = 0
p(3) = 0
p(4) = 0
p(5) = 0
p(6) = 0
p(7) = 0
p(8) = 1
p(n) <= 0 for all n >= 9
