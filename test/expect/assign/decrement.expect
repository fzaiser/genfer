Support is a subset of: {1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 1
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 0
Variance:                  V = 0
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = (not a rational)
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = (not a rational)

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 0
p(1) = 1
p(n) <= 0 for all n >= 2
