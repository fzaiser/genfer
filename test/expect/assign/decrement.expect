Support is a subset of: {1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 1
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 1
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 1
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 1
Standard deviation:        σ = 0
Variance (2nd central):    V = 0
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 0
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 0
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = (not a rational)
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = (not a rational)

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 0
p(1) = 1
p(n) <= 0 for all n >= 2
