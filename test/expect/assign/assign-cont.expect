Support is a subset of: [2, 2]

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 2.0
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 4.0
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 8.0
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 16.0
Standard deviation:        σ = 4.080851059445487e-8
Variance (2nd central):    V = 3.33066907387547e-15
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 8.881784197001252e-16
4th central moment:      μ_4 = -1.7763568394002517e-14
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = NaN
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = inf
