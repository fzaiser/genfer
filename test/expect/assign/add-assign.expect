Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 4.0
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 16.0
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 64.0
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 256.0
Standard deviation:        σ = 8.161702118890974e-8
Variance (2nd central):    V = 1.332267629550188e-14
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 7.105427357601002e-15
4th central moment:      μ_4 = -2.842170943040403e-13
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = NaN

Computing probabilities up to 5...
p(0) = 0.0
p(1) = 0.0
p(2) = 0.0
p(3) = 0.0
p(4) = 1.0
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 5
