Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 1/4
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = (not a rational)
Variance:                  V = 3/16
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = (not a rational)
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 7/3

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 3/4
p(1) = 1/4
p(n) <= 0 for all n >= 2
