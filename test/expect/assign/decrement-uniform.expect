Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1
Expected value:            E = 1/4
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 1/4
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 1/4
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 1/4
Standard deviation:        σ = (not a rational)
Variance (2nd central):    V = 3/16
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 3/32
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 21/256
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = (not a rational)
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 7/3

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 3/4
p(1) = 1/4
p(n) <= 0 for all n >= 2
