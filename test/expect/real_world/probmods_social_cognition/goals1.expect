Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 0.9
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 0.9
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 0.9
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 0.9
Standard deviation:        σ = 0.30000000000000004
Variance (2nd central):    V = 0.09000000000000002
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = -0.0719999999999999
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 0.06569999999999959
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = -2.6666666666666616
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 8.111111111111057

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 0.1
p(1) = 0.9
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 2
