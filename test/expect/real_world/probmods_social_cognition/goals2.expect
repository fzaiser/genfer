Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 0.7
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 0.7
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 0.7
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 0.7
Standard deviation:        σ = 0.45825756949558405
Variance (2nd central):    V = 0.21000000000000002
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = -0.08400000000000002
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 0.07769999999999982
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = -0.8728715609439694
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 1.7619047619047574

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 0.3
p(1) = 0.7
