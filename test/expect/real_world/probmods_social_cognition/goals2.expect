Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 0.7
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 0.45825756949558405
Variance:                  V = 0.21000000000000002
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = -0.8728715609439694
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 1.7619047619047574

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 0.3
p(1) = 0.7
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 2
