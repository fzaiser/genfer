Support is a subset of: {1, ..., 3}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 0.5
Expected value:            E = 2.0
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 0.9999999999999992
Variance:                  V = 0.9999999999999984
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 1.3322676295502068e-15
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 0.9999999999999862

Computing probabilities up to 4...
Unnormalized: p(0)     = 0.0
Normalized:   p(0) / Z = 0.0
Unnormalized: p(1)     = 0.25
Normalized:   p(1) / Z = 0.5
Unnormalized: p(2)     = 0.0
Normalized:   p(2) / Z = 0.0
Unnormalized: p(3)     = 0.25
Normalized:   p(3) / Z = 0.5
Unnormalized: p(n)     <= 0.0 for all n >= 4
Normalized:   p(n) / Z <= 0.0 for all n >= 4
