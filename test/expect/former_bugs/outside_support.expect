Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 0.5
Expected value:            E = 2.0
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 5.0
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 14.0
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 41.0
Standard deviation:        σ = 0.9999999999999992
Variance (2nd central):    V = 0.9999999999999984
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 1.3322676295501878e-15
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 0.9999999999999831

Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 0.9999999999999862

Computing probabilities up to 4...
Unnormalized: p(0)     = 0.0
Normalized:   p(0) / Z = 0.0
Unnormalized: p(1)     = 0.25
Normalized:   p(1) / Z = 0.5
Unnormalized: p(2)     = 0.0
Normalized:   p(2) / Z = 0.0
Unnormalized: p(3)     = 0.25
Normalized:   p(3) / Z = 0.5
Unnormalized: p(n)     <= 0.0 for all n >= 4
Normalized:   p(n) / Z <= 0.0 for all n >= 4
