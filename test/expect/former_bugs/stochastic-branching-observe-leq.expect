Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 0.5
Standard deviation:        Ïƒ = 0.5
Variance:                  V = 0.24999999999999997
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 0.0
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 0.9999999999999973

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 0.5
p(1) = 0.5
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 2
