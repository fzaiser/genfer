Support is a subset of: {0, ..., 1}

Computing moments...
Total measure:             Z = 1.0
Expected value:            E = 0.5
2nd raw moment:         μ'_2 = 0.5
3rd raw moment:         μ'_3 = 0.5
4th raw moment:         μ'_4 = 0.5
Standard deviation:        σ = 0.5
Variance (2nd central):    V = 0.24999999999999997
3rd central moment:      μ_3 = 0.0
4th central moment:      μ_4 = 0.06249999999999981
Skewness (3rd std moment): S = 0.0
Kurtosis (4th std moment): K = 0.9999999999999973

Computing probabilities up to 2...
p(0) = 0.5
p(1) = 0.5
p(n) <= 0.0 for all n >= 2
